      <p>Many people think they need to walk 10,000 steps  every day to be <strong>healthy.</strong> But new <strong>research</strong> shows this is not true. <strong>Scientists</strong> say 7,000 steps per day is <strong>enough</strong> for your health.</p>

      <p>Dr. Melody Ding did this research at the University of Sydney. She looked at different other researches about walking and health. She wanted to know how many steps people need to stay healthy.</p>

      <p>Her research was based on people who walk different amounts every day. People who walk 7,000 steps are healthier than people who walk only 2,000 steps. People who walk more have less risk of catching a cold. They also have less risk of heart disease and dementia. And even the risk of dying.</p>

      <p>Where does the 10,000 steps <strong>benchmark come from?</strong> Dr. Sean Heffron says this number is not from science. The 10,000 steps objective came from advertising in Japan. A company made a pedometer and called it "10,000 steps meter."</p>

      <p>Dr. Martha Gulati is a heart doctor. She does not trust round numbers like 10,000. She thinks these numbers are not always from science.</p>

      <p>The research shows that walking more is fundamental for good health. Dr. Ding says walking more than 7,000 steps is good. "If one is already very active and doing 10,000+ steps a day, they definitely don't need to hold back and go back to 7,000!" she said.</p>

      <p><strong>You don't need to worry if you can't walk 10,000 steps every day.</strong> Just walk a little more than you do now. This will help your health.</p>

      <p><strong>Learning English through stories is one of the most effective methods</strong> for language acquisition. When you read stories, you encounter vocabulary and grammar in context, which makes it easier to remember and use.</p>

      <p>Stories provide emotional connection and context that help your brain retain information better than isolated vocabulary lists. Your brain remembers words better when they are part of an interesting narrative.</p>

      <p>Start with simple stories at your level and gradually move to more complex texts. Don't worry about understanding every word - focus on the overall meaning and enjoy the story!</p>
