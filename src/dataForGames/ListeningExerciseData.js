But they didn’t build more parking garages. Instead, they tried to keep cars out of the city center. Recently, they started making people who drive their cars downtown pay a daily fee. You have to pay $10 if you want to drive your car into the center between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. At the same time, they have raised the parking lot rates, so people think twice before they drive their car into the city.\n' +

Special lanes on roads just for buses were built at the same time. If you’re caught driving your car in a bus lane, you have to pay a fine – and it’s a really high fine! Also, they passed a law last year that says you can only drive your car downtown three days a week.

They also made a rule that says there must be at least two people in your car if you want to drive downtown during the week. They also ordered these amazing new pollution-free buses.

They had tickets for a Turkish Airlines flight from Los Angeles to Dakar, the capital of Senegal in West Africa. However, an airline mix-up sent them 11,000 kilometres away from their destination, to another continent. They boarded their flight at Los Angeles International Airport in the USA. But unfortunately, an airline employee at the airport accidentally entered the wrong three-letter airport code into the flight booking system. The code for Dakar is DKR. But the employee entered DAC, which is the code for Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, in Asia.\n' +

          'At first, Sandy and her husband did not notice that there was a problem. When the flight attendant said they were heading to Dhaka, they thought she was saying ‘Dakar’ with a Turkish accent. Several hours into the trip they woke up from a long sleep and noticed the inflight map showed the plane over the Middle East. They then realised the plane was full of passengers who looked Asian, not African. That’s when they knew that there was a serious mistake. But there was nothing they could do about it: they had to continue all the way to Bangladesh!\n' +

To say sorry, Turkish Airlines offered the passengers two free econo class tickets to any destination it flies to.' +
